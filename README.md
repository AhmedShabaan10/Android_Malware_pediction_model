Notebook Overview
This Jupyter notebook focuses on Android malware detection using machine learning. The workflow includes data preprocessing, encoding, splitting into training, validation, and test sets, feature scaling, model selection, evaluation, and visualization.

Dataset Cleaning
The dataset underwent cleaning processes, including handling null values, encoding categorical data, and removing unnecessary columns.

Data Splitting
The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets for model evaluation.

Feature Scaling
MinMax scaling was applied to normalize the feature values.

Model Selection and Evaluation
Several machine learning models were evaluated, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Complement Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree Classifier. Model performance was assessed on both the training and validation sets.

Model Testing
The best-performing model (Decision Tree Classifier) was tested on the independent test set.

Results Visualization
Results were visualized using bar plots to compare training, validation, and test accuracies for each model.

Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix was generated and visualized for the Decision Tree Classifier on the validation set.

Decision Tree Visualization
The decision tree model was visualized to understand its decision-making process.
